How to run the app anywhere (with a tunnel):
- Connect laptop and iPhone to a fast Wi-Fi (preferably not hotspot)
- sudo npx expo start --tunnel --reset-cache
- OR npx expo start (must be on same Wi-Fi, preferably hotspot)
- Then others can connect too. They may have to join your hotspot first, then they can connect to a public network.


//NOT NEEDED
To run the server (and enable live obstacle reporting accross different devices):
- Make sure all devices, including the computer hosting the server, and all smartphones,
  are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
- Go into config.js, change the SERVER_IP variable to your local IP address 
  on the Wi-Fi network (ipconfig command or settings)
- Run server in hero server folder: node server.js
- It's better to show two terminals with the Expo Go logs on one side, and server.js 
  on the other
